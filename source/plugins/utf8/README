Parts of the code in this library come from other places, under different
licenses. The authors involved have been contacted (see below). Attribution for
which code came from elsewhere can be found in the source code itself.

* Andreas Gohr / Chris Smith - Dokuwiki: there was a fair degree of
  collaboration/exchange of ideas and code beteen Dokuwiki's UTF-8 library
  (https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:utf-8) and phputf8. Although Dokuwiki is
  released under GPL, its UTF-8 library is released under LGPL, hence no
  conflict with phputf8.

* Henri Sivonen (http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/) has also given permission for
  his code to be released under the terms of the LGPL. He ported a Unicode /
  UTF-8 converter from the Mozilla codebase to PHP, which is re-used in phputf8.
