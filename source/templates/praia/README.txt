Browser compatibility
---------------------

The template yields best viewing experience on modern browsers such as recent
versions of Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari and Opera. It works fine
under IE8 too. In IE7 the menu is somewhat ragged but fully usable. In IE6 the
dropdown menu doesn't work at all, so the locator and submenu are displayed to
compensate for the deficiency. The template is fully usable even on text
browsers/screenreaders.

The menu is build with xtoc28 from Tillmann Schuster <http://nmud.de/>.
